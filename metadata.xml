    <description> Take control of the world with this amazing timeless item!

Gain the ability to stop time for all but yourself for a few seconds with this definately-not-a-jojo-ripoff item!

This mod is an updated version of Sora's long defunct Chronoscope mod. Repentance-compatible and most old synergies (and some new additional ones) should function.

The shaders and certain mechanics have also been changed. TODO for future releases: Fix familiars, laser items other than brimstone and tech, and most brimstone synergies.

Obviously, huge thanks to Sora for the base code.</description>
