# Description

Take control of the world with this amazing timeless item!  

Gain the ability to stop time for all but yourself for a few seconds with this definitely-not-a-jojo-ripoff item!

## Improvements

This mod is an **updated** version of Sora's long defunct Chronoscope mod.
- Repentance-compatible 
- Synergies from previous iteration function, along with some new additional ones
- Shaders and sfx overhaul
- No mutual compatibility with Sora's version
- Explosions, enemy projectiles, and familiars are halted as envisioned

## Features

- EID and Encyclopedia mod support
- ModConfigMenu mod support, which can be used to configure sound effects
   - Toggle main sound effect variant
   - Toggle character voice overs

## Notes for future releases

- Fix familiars turning on player's turning direction (if even possible)
